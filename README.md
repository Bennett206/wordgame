Word Game using Django

This game is in a VERY early stage with little to no logic added.

Recent changes include the addition of an ajax statement that checks if the inputed word is an english word or not.

The letter buttons are generated using the functions in wordgame.py

My next plan is to introduce logic similar to the game boggle in how you are able to construct your words to submit as well as visual updates!
