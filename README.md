Word Game using Django

This game is in a VERY early stage with little to no logic added.

Recent changes:

- Addition of an ajax statement that checks if the inputed word is an english word or not.
- Functionality of the Django database which takes inputs of the word, whether it's vaild or not, and the point total for the new word.

The letter buttons are generated using the functions in wordgame.py

My next plan is to introduce logic similar to the game boggle in limitations to how you are able to construct your words as well as minor visual updates!
